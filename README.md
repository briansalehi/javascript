## Contribute

Feel free to add or update any of the practice files.  
You should consider a few things before adding or updating any practice:

* to add a practice, put the file's name in the **.list** file, in order!
* *refresh.sh* script will set file numbers automatically, based on orders in *.list* file, so don't bother numbering!
* practice files should be named properly, say *"console.js"*, related to their topics
* each practice should clearly explain only 1 topic
* each practice should be as minimal as possible
* practices should contain a *clean code*!
* update any practice if you feel there can be a better way to explain them
* write your comments in *filename.comment.txt* files, this goes below the code section in markdown file
* title your code in *filename.title.txt* files, this goes to markdown file header
* do not touch auto generated *md5sum.txt*, *output.txt* and *.md* files
